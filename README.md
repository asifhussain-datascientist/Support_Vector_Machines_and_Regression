# Support Vector Machines and Regression

# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Regression techniques for predictive modeling. The project involves building and tuning SVM models, analyzing performance, and applying regression analysis for both linear and non-linear datasets.

# Key Features
* **Dataset**: Various datasets (to be detailed in the notebook) are used to train and evaluate SVM and regression models.
* **Objective**: To demonstrate the use of SVM for classification and regression analysis, showcasing model tuning and feature importance.

# Tools Used:
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn for model implementation and evaluation
* Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
* Project Structure
* Support Vector Machines and Regression.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing:
* Introduction to SVM and regression techniques
* Data Loading and Preprocessing
* Model building for Support Vector Classification (SVC)
* Implementation of Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
* Performance Evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and RMSE for regression tasks
* Visualization of decision boundaries and regression lines

# Usage
* Load the dataset in the notebook and run the code cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the SVM and regression models.
* Modify hyperparameters or datasets as needed for experimentation.
* Visualize model performance and interpret the results using the built-in plots and evaluation metrics.

# Results
* Support Vector Classification:
Implemented SVC for binary and multi-class classification problems.
Tuned hyperparameters (C, gamma, kernel) for optimal performance.
* Support Vector Regression:
Demonstrated the use of SVR for predicting continuous outcomes.
Evaluated model performance using error metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.
* Visualization:
Plots of decision boundaries for classification problems.
Regression lines for SVR showing prediction accuracy.

# Future Work
* Kernel Trick Exploration: Further exploration of non-linear kernels such as polynomial and radial basis functions (RBF) for improved performance.
* Model Comparison: Compare SVM results with other classifiers and regressors such as Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
